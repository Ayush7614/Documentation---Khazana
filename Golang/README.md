# What is Go Language ?
---
Go 0r Golang is a programming language which is developed by Google in 2007.
Go is a statically-typed language.
 Go has a similar syntax to C.
 It is developed with the vision of high performance and fast development.

# Why Golang ?
---
The main purpose of designing Golang was to eliminate the problems of existing languages.
- Go is modern, fast and comes with a powerful standard library.
- Go has built-in concurrency.
- Go uses interfaces as the building blocks of code reusability.

# Downloading and Installing Golang 
- Before starting with the installation process, you need to [download](https://go.dev/dl/) it.
- Download the Golang according to your system architecture and follow the further instructions for the installation of Golang.
- Click Next and follow the steps accordingly.
- Now Let‚Äôs check the Golang version by using the command go version on command prompt.
- After completing the installation process, any IDE or text editor can be used to write Golang.

## Go Example
To run a Go program you need a Go compiler.
In Go compiler, first you create a program and save your program with extension .go, for example, first.go.

`package main`  
`import "fmt"`  
`func main()`
`{  
   fmt.Println("Hello, World")  
}`

Now we run this first.go file in the go compiler using the following command, i.e:
`$ go run first.go`

##### Output : `Hello, World`
