# What is Scala ?
---
Scala Programming is a general-purpose language that combines concepts of object-oriented and functional programming languages. It was developed to overcome the problems faced by other languages and can easily be integrated into existing code.

# Why Scala ?
---
- It is an **object-oriented language**.
- Scala design to run on a **JVM platform** that helps indirectly using Java libraries.
- Scala Programming  is **statically typed** that prevents it from problems of dynamically typing.
- It is **easy** to implement.
- It is getting **popular** in industry.

# Why it is popular ?
One of the key reasons for Scala’s success is its close integration with Java.
For web-based development projects, Scala Programming  can even compile to JavaScript.
 Scala Programming is far beyond an alternative to Java.
 It is a more concise language that utilizes simple, easy-to-read syntax, and requires just a fraction of the lines of code when compared to a typical Java program.
 Due to the above reasons, companies like Linkedin, Twitter etc have the majority of their code bases of Scala Programming.

## Prerequisites 
Scala Programming is based on Java, so if you have knowledge of Java syntax, then it’s pretty easy to learn Scala. But if you do not know Java but are aware of any other programming language like C, C++ or Python then also you can learn Scala Programming  very quickly.

---
## Getting Started with Scala?
- We know that Scala runs on the JVM. So for Scala Environment Setup, you’ll need to have Java installed on your machine.
- Now, we’ll need to [Install Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/).
- Next Next, Install & Finish.
- Now, when you get in the command prompt, type scala
- This will give you the Scala prompt.

 ## Eg)  scala> println("Hello")

---

### Whoooo Ooohhhh🤘🥳, You have installed and wrote the first line in scala. 

---
#### Now you can dive deep into more learning the Scala Language  🚀

## Summary
If you’re new to programming or looking for a fast, modern language that is a combination of object-oriented and functional programming, Scala must be your choice that is definitely a language worth learning. 

## Good luck with the progress, continue to learn 💙🙌🏻
